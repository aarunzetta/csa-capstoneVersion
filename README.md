## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with hot module replacement enabled.

### Build for Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

Locally preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## API Integration

The dashboard integrates with a backend API for:

- **Dashboard Stats** - Fetches total passengers, drivers, rides, admins, and active drivers
- **Rides Data** - Retrieves ride history with pickup/dropoff locations and timestamps
- **User Management** - CRUD operations for passengers, drivers, and admins

### Example API Response (Dashboard Stats)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalPassengers": 924,
    "totalDrivers": 420,
    "totalRides": 3169,
    "totalAdmins": 5,
    "todayRides": 169,
    "activeDrivers": 402
  }
}
```

## Key Composables

- **useDashboard** - Manages dashboard statistics and data fetching
- **useRides** - Handles ride data retrieval and management
- **useApi** - Custom API client with error handling

## Authentication

Routes are protected with the `auth` middleware. Ensure users are authenticated before accessing protected pages.
